## Controls

> Use the arrow keys to move around the picture

> `p` to zoom in

> `o` to zoom out

## Mouse

The position of the mouse mapped to it's complex coordinate is displayed in the top right. The red dots displayed are each iteration of `z = z^2 + c`. This can be interesting as you can see how the iterations of any given point change in real time by just moving the mouse.
