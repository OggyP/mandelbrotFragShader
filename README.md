## Controls

> Use the arrow keys to move around the picture

> `scroll` to zoom

> `mouse` to navigate

> `r` to reset the clock

> `1` to toggle showing z^2+c

> `p` to pause the current power of z

## Mouse

The position of the mouse mapped to it's complex coordinate is displayed in the top right. The red dots displayed are each iteration of `z = z^2 + c`. This can be interesting as you can see how the iterations of any given point change in real time by just moving the mouse.
